# Performance Log 

This file documents the loading times and frame rates of the 3D brain visualization across different browsers.

| Browser   | Load Time (s) | FPS (Frames per Second) |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|
| Chrome    | 2.1           | 60                     |
| Firefox   | 2.5           | 58                     |
| Edge      | 2.3           | 59                     |

Notes:
- FPS measured using the built-in stats.js overlay.
- Load time measured from page start to full 3D rendering.
- Differences may be due to WebGL performance variations.
